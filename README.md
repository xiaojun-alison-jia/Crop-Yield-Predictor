# Crop-Yield-Predictor
Used hyperspectral data from the growing season to predict corn yield in harvest season from the state of Illinois

Optimized data cleansing by numpy.dstack and numpy.ma. Improved runtime efficiency by 95%

Predicted yield based on Random Forest and related models with over 80% accuracy

Used Matplotlib in Python to construct visualizations of yield estimation
